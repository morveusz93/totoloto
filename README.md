lotto lottery simulation, + data analize

it is my first mini-project

I'm going to create a simulation of x draws and save the results.
Then analyze the data and print it with pleasing to the eye style.

E.G.:
-make some multiple draws. save the results
-then print how many times you won (3,4,5 and 6 guessed numbers)
-option to print how many times ever you get 6/6 and how meny times comp did draw numbers(data from file)
